> ### Let's learn how to deploy something with Docker!
A small NGINX web server with Docker deployment.

**Environment**: `Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Windows 11 WLS2)`

**How to run**: Execute `buildandrun.sh` with root permission. The Dockerfile build and executing container will proceed automatically. And, visit `http://localhost:80` in your browser. Because NGINX server is running, you'll show a page written as `custom-index.html`.
